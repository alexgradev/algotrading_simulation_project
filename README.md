# Algotrading Simulation Project

This repo stores my biggest R project so far - algorithmic trading strategy based on machine learning with the goal of outperforming the market by leveraging data-driven insights and classification models. The ML algorithms are trained on various data, technical metrics and SMA crossover strategies derived from the historical price. The resulting trading strategy achieved an Inception-to-Date Return of 89.01%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 benchmark return of 42.75% over the same period. 

I will write a better description of the project soon and upload the finished notebook as well as a presentation with the final results.

If you find it interesting, do not hesitate to contact me :)
